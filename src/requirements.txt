# Note: freqtrade is purposely left out as it is needed for development and notebook execution, but not for training.
#  Amazon Sagemaker will try to use this requirements.txt to replicate our environment, which is a good thing, but the
#  Sagemaker docker image does not contain the necessary TA-Lib library. You can work around this with https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/advanced_functionality/pytorch_extending_our_containers/pytorch_extending_our_containers.ipynb
#  though that is currently outside the scope of this project (i.e. adds to much friction for not much value).
