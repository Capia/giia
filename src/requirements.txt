torch==1.12.1

# Do I need this while using darts?
pytorch-lightning==1.9.4

tensorboard==2.12.0
darts==0.23.1
# pytorch-forecasting==0.10.3

# mxnet==1.9.0
## cu112 as sagemaker gpu image uses CUDA 11.2 (https://pypi.org/project/mxnet-cu112/)
# mxnet-cu101==1.9.*
## Sagemaker's images come with the appropriate mxnet version (CPU or GPU based). Though if you are running this
## locally, be sure to install the version you machine is compatible with. Lastly, the version pinned here should be
## the same version found in train.py

# freqtrade==2023.1
## freqtrade is purposely left out as it is needed for development and notebook execution, but not for training.
##  Amazon Sagemaker will use this requirements.txt to replicate our environment, which is a good thing, but the
##  Sagemaker docker image does not contain the necessary TA-Lib library. You can work around this with https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/advanced_functionality/pytorch_extending_our_containers/pytorch_extending_our_containers.ipynb
##  though that is currently outside the scope of this project (i.e. adds to much friction for not much value).
