# an official release for it yet. The official release that will likely contain the changes we need will be 0.8.x

## Note: the packages below need to be installed manually. However, the versions provided here are the
## recommended version to install. KEEP THEM UPDATED

mxnet==1.9.1
# mxnet-cu101==1.9.*
## Sagemaker's images come with the appropriate mxnet version (CPU or GPU based). Though if you are running this
## locally, be sure to install the version you machine is compatible with. Lastly, the version pinned here should be
## the same version found in train.py

freqtrade==2023.1
## freqtrade is purposely left out as it is needed for development and notebook execution, but not for training.
##  Amazon Sagemaker will use this requirements.txt to replicate our environment, which is a good thing, but the
##  Sagemaker docker image does not contain the necessary TA-Lib library. You can work around this with https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/advanced_functionality/pytorch_extending_our_containers/pytorch_extending_our_containers.ipynb
##  though that is currently outside the scope of this project (i.e. adds to much friction for not much value).
